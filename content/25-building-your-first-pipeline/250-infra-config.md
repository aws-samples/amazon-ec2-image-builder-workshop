Finally we need to set our **Infrastructure Configuration**. We will make some changes such as using a different IAM role and selecting a modern instance type. 

1. Select **Create a new infrastructure configuration**
2. **Give the configuration a name**
3. **Select the correct IAM Role**, this will give our build instance permissions such as sending logs to CloudWatch or grabbing files from s3..

**If you don't know what the TeamRole is**, or if it doesn't exist in your account. **Review [Prerequisites: EC2 Instance Profile]({{< ref "300-instance-profile.md" >}})**
