Welcome, this workshop is aimed at engineers planning to build their own images for EC2 instances. In this workshop we will cover the following topics. 

| Topic | Duration |
| ---- | ----- |
| The concepts of EC2 Image Builder | (5-10 min) |
| How to build an image pipeline through the console | (60 min) |
| How to locally develop your own components | (60 min) | 

**After completing this workshop you will be able** to build your own image pipelines from scratch!

## Prior knowledge 

Before starting this workshop you should have some knowledge of [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc) and [IAM roles](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).

For the ["Building your own components"]({{< ref "30-building-your-own-components/_index.md" >}} "About Us") section of this workshop, basic understanding of bash or PowerShell is recommended.

## Cost estimate

The estimated cost for running this workshop less than `$1.00`. This workshop requires (short-lived) EC2 instances. In this workshop we will use `c5.large` instances, that fall outside of the free tier.
