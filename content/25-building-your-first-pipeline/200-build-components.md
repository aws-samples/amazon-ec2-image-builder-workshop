Let's start by adding [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest) to our image.

1. In the search field enter `powershell`.
2. Select `powershell-windows from the returned results`

Note there are **different versions of the component available**. Component version also **supports** the **`x.x.x` syntax**. By default, the console will reference the latest version.
